What is cpuminer-multi
----------------------

[**tpruvot/cpuminer-multi**](https://github.com/tpruvot/cpuminer-multi) is a multi-threaded CPU miner, fork of pooler's [cpuminer](https://github.com/pooler) (see AUTHORS for list of contributors).

It can mine almost all crypto currencies using CPU. This means you're a lot less likely to get a block, so
you might want to join a pool like https://www.multipool.us/dashboard/help/


Usage example
-------------

  $ docker run --rm wernight/cpuminer-multi cpuminer --cputest
